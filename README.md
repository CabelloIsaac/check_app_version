# Check App Version (Flutter)

A plugin that allows you to check the version of the app installed with a hypothetical version of the app published on the PlayStore / AppStore.

## About

The plugin compares two version codes:
- The code for the app installed on the device.
- Code for a new version of the app compiled using JSON.

In fact the package acquires the necessary information for the comparison between the two versions, through a JSON file compiled by the user himself.

Example of a JSON file at this address[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/).

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
